# Problem Description: Home Manager Ghostty Configuration Not Deploying

## Overview
The user is attempting to deploy a `ghostty` terminal emulator configuration using Home Manager within a NixOS/Home Manager dotfiles repository that utilizes the Denix framework. Despite `nh home switch .` reporting successful activation, the `ghostty` configuration file (`~/.config/ghostty/config`) is not being created or updated on the system.

## Context
- **Project Structure**: NixOS/Home Manager dotfiles using the Denix framework.
- **Ghostty Configuration**: Defined in `modules/programs/ghostty/default.nix`. This module uses `home.ifEnabled` and `xdg.configFile."ghostty/config"` to link to `../../../.config/ghostty/ghostty.linux` for Linux systems.
- **Enabling Ghostty**: The `ghostty` module is enabled via the `hyprland` feature module (`modules/features/hyprland.nix`), which sets `myconfig.programs.ghostty.enable = true;` for NixOS.
- **Home Manager Command**: The user is running `nh home switch .` to apply the configuration.

## Steps Taken & Observations
1.  **Initial Problem**: `nh home switch .` was failing.
2.  **Space Issue**: Repeatedly encountered "No space left on device" errors during `nh home build .` and `nh home switch .`. This was resolved by the user clearing space.
3.  **`nh home switch .` Success**: After clearing space, `nh home switch .` now reports successful completion (Exit Code 0).
4.  **Missing Config File**: Despite successful activation, the file `/home/connerohnesorge/.config/ghostty/config` does *not* exist on the system (verified by `cat` command).
5.  **Home Manager Profile Inspection**:
    *   The current Home Manager generation path was identified as `/nix/store/q864gdb1gnsqr1x58sd43hsbidqw7yhd-home-manager-generation`.
    *   Attempts to list or find `ghostty` related files within this generation (e.g., `/nix/store/.../etc/xdg/xdg-home-manager/` or using `find`) yielded no results.

## Current Hypothesis
The `ghostty` module, despite being enabled in `modules/features/hyprland.nix`, is not being correctly included or activated in the final Home Manager profile. This could be due to:
-   The `hyprland` feature itself not being enabled in the user's specific host configuration.
-   An issue with how `delib.module` or `singleEnableOption` interacts within the Denix framework, preventing the `xdg.configFile` from being properly registered.
-   A caching issue or an unexpected interaction within the Nix/Home Manager ecosystem that prevents the symlink from being created.

## Next Steps for New Agent
1.  **Identify Active Host**: Determine which host configuration (e.g., `oxe-nixos`, `xps-nixos`) the user is currently applying Home Manager to.
2.  **Verify Feature Enablement**: Read the `default.nix` of the identified host to confirm that `myconfig.features.hyprland.enable = true;` is explicitly set.
3.  **Deep Dive into Denix/Home Manager Interaction**: If the feature is enabled, investigate how `delib.module` and `xdg.configFile` are processed by Home Manager in this specific setup to understand why the file is not being deployed. This might involve looking at the generated Nix store paths more closely or examining Home Manager's internal logs/debug output if available.
4.  **Propose Solution**: Based on the findings, propose a solution to ensure the `ghostty` configuration is correctly deployed. This might involve adjusting the module definition, the host configuration, or a workaround if a framework limitation is identified.
