However, your Stylix configuration is explicitly overriding this to use \"qtct\" instead.\n\n**Why This Happens:**\n\n- KDE Plasma 6 desktop environment expects Qt applications to use the \"kde6\" platform for proper theming integration\n- Your Stylix configuration is forcing Qt to use \"qtct\" (Qt Configuration Tool) platform instead\n- This creates a collision where two different parts of the system are trying to set conflicting values for the same Qt platform setting\n\n**Files Involved:**\n\n1. **Setting \"qtct\"**: `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/rices/dark/default.nix` (line 129)\n2. **Enabling KDE**: `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/hosts/oxe-nixos/default.nix` (line 70)\n3. **KDE module**: `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/features/kde.nix` (includes qt6ct package but doesn't set platform)\n\n**Recommended Solutions:**\n\n1. **For KDE + Stylix compatibility**: Change the Stylix qt platform to \"kde6\" when KDE is enabled\n2. **Remove qtct platform setting**: Let KDE handle Qt theming natively\n3. **Use conditional configuration**: Set different qt platforms based on which desktop environment is enabled\n\nThe \"kde6\" setting is not explicitly set in your dotfiles - it's being set automatically by NixOS when KDE Plasma 6 is enabled, while your Stylix configuration is conflicting with this by trying to force \"qtct\"."

          "text": "Perfect! Now I see what's happening. The user is suggesting that ghostty should probably be enabled in the dark rice configuration, specifically in the `home` attribute. Looking at the current structure, I can see that the rice has:\n\n1. A `home` section for Darwin\n2. A `nixos` section \n\nBut there's no `home` section for Linux (the `home = if pkgs.stdenv.isDarwin then { ... } else {}` means it's empty for Linux). \n\nLet me now look for any current logic where ghostty might be automatically enabled. Based on my analysis, here's what I found:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nAfter searching through the codebase, I discovered that **ghostty is NOT currently being automatically enabled when Hyprland is active**. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Where ghostty is mentioned:\n- **`/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/programs/ghostty/default.nix`**: The ghostty program module itself\n- **`/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/features/hyprland.nix`**: Hyprland feature installs ghostty as a system package\n\n### 2. The current situation:\n\n**In `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/features/hyprland.nix`** (lines 104):\n```nix\nenvironment = {\n  systemPackages = [\n    inputs.ghostty.packages.\"${pkgs.system}\".default  # <- ghostty is installed here\n    inputs.hyprland.packages.\"${pkgs.system}\".default\n    # ... other packages\n  ];\n};\n```\n\nSo ghostty is installed as a system package when Hyprland is enabled, but this doesn't activate the ghostty program module which handles Home Manager configuration and the config files.\n\n### 3. The missing link:\n\nThe documentation in `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/programs/ghostty/default.nix` (line 44-48) claims:\n```nix\n## Usage\nEnabled automatically when Hyprland feature is active, or can be enabled\nindividually via:\n```nix\nmyconfig.programs.ghostty.enable = true;\n```\n\n**But there's no actual code that automatically enables `myconfig.programs.ghostty.enable = true` when Hyprland is active.**\n\n### 4. What should happen:\n\nBased on the user's insight, ghostty should probably be enabled in one of these places:\n\n1. **In the dark rice's home configuration** (since that's where terminal theme configuration would make sense)\n2. **In the Hyprland feature module** by adding `myconfig.programs.ghostty.enable = true;`\n3. **Through some automatic dependency resolution** (but this doesn't currently exist in the codebase)\n\nThe current setup only installs the ghostty binary but doesn't enable the Home Manager configuration that sets up the config files (`ghostty.linux` or `ghostty.macos`) and the proper program integration.\n\n### Files examined:\n- `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/features/hyprland.nix`\n- `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/programs/ghostty/default.nix`\n- `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/modules/features/engineer.nix`\n- `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/rices/dark/default.nix`\n- `/home/connerohnesorge/dotfiles/hosts/xps-nixos/default.nix`\n\nThe documentation is incorrect \u2013 ghostty is not automatically enabled when Hyprland is active, only installed as a package."

Supports platform-specific configuration\nfor Linux and macOS environments.\n\n## Platform Support\n- \u2705 NixOS (Linux)\n- \u2705 Darwin (macOS)\n\n## Features\n- **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated text rendering\n- **Unicode Support**: Full Unicode and emoji support\n- **Shell Integration**: Deep shell integration with zsh\n- **Platform Optimization**: Different settings for Linux and macOS\n- **Modern Terminal Features**: True color, ligatures, and more\n\n## Configuration Differences\n### Linux\n- Window decorations disabled for better tiling window manager integration\n- Optimized for desktop Linux environments\n\n### macOS\n- Window decorations enabled (native macOS window chrome)\n- Integrated with macOS system conventions\n\n## Common Settings\n- **Font**: CodeNewRoman Nerd Font for programming\n- **Shell**: zsh with full integration\n- **Theme**: Dark background (#000000)\n- **Key Bindings**: shift+enter for newline insertion\n- **Working Directory**: Inherits from parent process\n\n## Integration Points\n- Works with Hyprland tiling window manager (Linux)\n- Integrates with macOS window management\n- Compatible with zsh configurations\n- Supports development workflows\n\n## Usage\nEnabled automatically when Hyprland feature is active, or can be enabled\nindividually via:\n```nix\nmyconfig.programs.ghostty.enable = true;\n```\n\n## Implementation\nUses Home Manager to deploy platform-specific configuration files:\n- Linux: Uses ghostty.linux config (no window decorations)\n- macOS: Uses ghostty.macos config (with window decorations)\n*/\n{\n  delib,\n  pkgs,\n  ...\n}: let\n  inherit (delib) singleEnableOption;\n  inherit (pkgs.stdenv) isDarwin isLinux;\nin\n  delib.module {\n    name = \"programs.ghostty\";\n\n    options = singleEnableOption false;\n\n    home.ifEnabled = {\n      # Enable Ghostty terminal emulator program\n      programs.ghostty = {\n        enable = true;\n        package = pkgs.ghostty or null;\n      };\n\n      # Deploy platform-specific configuration file\n      xdg.configFile.\"ghostty/config\" = {\n        source =\n          if isLinux\n          then ../../../.config/ghostty/ghostty.linux\n          else if isDarwin\n          then ../../../.config/ghostty/ghostty.macos\n          else throw \"Unsupported platform for Ghostty configuration\";\n      };\n    };\n  }\n",
